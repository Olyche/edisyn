Edisyn's executable is entirely contained within the jar file

	edisyn.1.jar

You'll need to have installed the coremidi4j-1.0.jar file first (see the
file libraries/README for instructions, they're easy).

You also need to have Java installed on your computer.

You can run Edisyn by double-clicking on this file.
