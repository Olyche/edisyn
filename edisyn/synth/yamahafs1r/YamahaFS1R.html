<h1>Yamaha FS1R</h1> 
<h2>Voice Patch Editor</h2>

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>
Set the FS1R's to receive System Exclusive, Bulk Dumps, Bank Selection, and Program Change.  That is, set Rcv SysExcl, RcvBulkDump, Rcv BankSel, and Rcv PgmChng to ON.  Set the FS1R's Device Number to either ALL or to the Synth ID in Edisyn's MIDI panel.  Set Edisyn's send and receive MIDI channels to the FS1R's receive and send channels respectively. 

<br><br><h3>About the FS1R Menu</h3>

The menu has several options which hopefully make working with the patch editor more useful:

<ul>
<li><b>Set Up Test Performance for Part 1 Only</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This builds a Performance and sends it to the FS1R where all parts are turned ofF except for Part 1.  Part 1 has its Filter Switch turned on so you can test your Voice with the filter, and also has its Receive MIDI Channel set to Edisyn's outgoing MIDI Channel.

<p><li><b>Work With Part (1,2,3,4)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes Edisyn to use the given Part when sending and requesting the current voice patch.You probably want to set this to Part 1.  

<p><li><b>Swap Operators...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you swap two operators, including voiced and/or unvoiced parameters.

<p><li><b>Copy Operators...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you copy an operator to another, including voiced and/or unvoiced parameters.  You can of course copy an operator to another using Edisyn's copy tab menu options, but you can't filter for voiced or unvoiced parameters.

<p><li><b>Copy Voiced->Unvoiced</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This copies relevant voiced parameters to the equivalent unvoiced parameters in an operator.

<p><li><b>Copy Unvoiced->Voiced</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This copies relevant unvoiced parameters to the equivalent voiced parameters in an operator. 

</ul>

<br><br><h3>How Send to Current Patch and Request Current Patch Work</h3>

Voices can't be played alone: they have to be placed in a Part in a performance and played there.  To do this, Send to Current Patch sends the voice to the current Performance in the part number specified with the <b>Work with Part...</b> menu above.  Similarly, Request Current Patch requests that part.

<br><br><h3>Loading DX7 Patches</h3>

It's easy: just use the DX7 Editor.
