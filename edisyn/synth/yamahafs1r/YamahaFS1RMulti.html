<h1>Yamaha FS1R</h1> 
<h2>Performance Patch Editor</h2>

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>
Set the FS1R's to receive System Exclusive, Bulk Dumps, Bank Selection, and Program Change.  That is, set Rcv SysExcl, RcvBulkDump, Rcv BankSel, and Rcv PgmChng to ON.  Set the FS1R's Device Number to either ALL or to the Synth ID in Edisyn's MIDI panel.  Set Edisyn's send and receive MIDI channels to the FS1R's receive and send channels respectively. 

<br><br><h3>About the FS1R Menu</h3>

The menu has several options which hopefully make working with the patch editor more useful:

<ul>
<p><li><b>Swap Parts...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you swap two parts.

<p><li><b>Copy Parts...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you copy a part to another.  You can of course also do this with Edisyn's copy tab menu.

</ul>

<br><br><h3>Loading DX7 Patches</h3>

It's easy: just use the DX7 Editor.
