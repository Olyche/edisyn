<h1>Yamaha FS1R</h1> 
<h2>Fseq Patch Editor</h2>

This editor handles Fseqs only.  

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>
Set the FS1R's to receive System Exclusive, Bulk Dumps, Bank Selection, and Program Change.  That is, set Rcv SysExcl, RcvBulkDump, Rcv BankSel, and Rcv PgmChng to ON.  Set the Program Change Mode to "Multi".  Set the FS1R's Device Number to either ALL or to the Synth ID in Edisyn's MIDI panel.  For most MIDI devices, you can probably reduce the FS1R's Dump Interval to 50ms.  Set Edisyn's send and receive MIDI channels to the FS1R's receive and send channels respectively. 

<p>Finally, and this one is important: if you are planning on actually writing Fseqs to internal memory, you'll need to change the FS1R's internal memory organization to 64 Voice patches and 6 Fseq slots.  To do this, under <b>Util</b>, go to <b>System</b>, then <b>Others</b>, then change <b>Mem</b> (Memory Allocation) to <b>"IntVoice64"</b>.    Note that this will <b>erase all existing internal voices and Fseqs</b>.

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>
<ul>
<li>This editor does not support real-time Fseq parameter changes.
