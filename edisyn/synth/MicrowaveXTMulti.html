<h1>Waldorf Microwave II / XT / XTk</h1> 
<h2>Multi Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Microwave II,</b> the <b>Waldorf Microwave XT,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Microwave XTk</b> in 10 voice or in 30 voice.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Microwave to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex.</b>  Also set <b>Receive</b> to on.

<p><b>XTk Options</b> Two options are only available for the Microwave XTk:

<ul>
<li><b>MIDI Send</b> (In General) Set this to <i>Global</i> to send MIDI on all instruments regardless of their individual settings.  Set this to <i>Specific</i> to allow individual instruments to specify whether they want their MIDI sent.
<li><b>MIDI Send</b> (In each Instrument) determines whether a given instrument will send its MIDI out.  This is overridden by the General option above.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b> Only one.

<ul>
<li>If you load the current patch, the Microwave does not tell Edisyn what the patch number.  Thus Edisyn resets the Number to <b>1</b>.   Beware of this, as you may more than once accidentally write the patch to 1.
</ul>
