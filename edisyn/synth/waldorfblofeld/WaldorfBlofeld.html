<h1>Waldorf Blofeld</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Blofeld,</b> the <b>Waldorf Blofeld with SL Option,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard</b> (which automatically comes with the SL option).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Blofeld to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex</b>.  Also make sure that <b>Ctrl Receive</b> is on.

<p><b>SL Option</b> The SL option gives you the option of specifying a <b>sound sample</b> instead of a <b>wave</b> on Oscillators 1 and 2. This is turned on by choosing a <b>Sample Bank</b> in the editor: then the wave menu turns into a sample menu.  You turn it off by choosing <b>None</b> in the Sample Bank.  BTW, if you're wondering why Edisyn's SL Sample Banks end at Bank L, that's the furthest a contributor could get his to go before crashing his Blofeld.  So there you go.  

<p><b>Uploading Wavetables</b> Under the Blofeld menu you'll find an option to upload a wavetable.  You can upload wavetables from three different formats:

<ul>
<li><b>WAV files from http://waveeditonline.com</b>  This is a large collection of WAV files encoding wavetables for other devices.  You can even download all of them as one zip file.  Edisyn will convert them to the Blofeld as best it can (resampling to the Blofeld's lower sampling rate).  These are particularly good because there is a very nice free wavetable editor available, <b>http://synthtech.com/waveedit</b>
<p><li><b>Sysex files in SYX or MID format.</b>  These are groups of one or more wavetables in standard Blofeld sysex.  Some good sources for these are:
<ul><li>Stromeko's Waldorf downloads page.   <b>http://synth.stromeko.net/Downloads.html</b>
<P><li>MarsMelons's custom wavetables.  <b>http://www.marsmelons.com/custom-wavetables-waldorf-blofeld/</b>
<p><li>Big Gnome's VFX wavetables.  <b>https://tinyurl.com/vfxwavetables</b> (from <b>https://waldorfmusic.com/en/forum/blofeld-en/76-sharing-custom-set-of-blofeld-wavetables</b>)
</ul>
</ul>

<b>Important note:</b> You probaby want to turn Limit WT <i>off</i> when using user wavetables.  Otherwise the Blofeld will not work properly with any PWM values greater than 120.

<p><b>Uploading Pseudo-MPE</b> The Blofeld doesn't support MPE.  But it does support 16 separate patch slots in a multimode patch, which can be taken advantage of by instruments such as the Linnstrument. To do this each slot must be identical except for a unique MIDI channel, and each slot must be set to the desired single patch.  You can do this in two ways.

<ul>
<li><b>Write Patch as Psuedo-MPE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This writes a multimode patch which points to your current single patch, including the current name, bank, and (single patch) number.  You get to choose what multimode patch number to write to.

<p><li><b>Write Pseudo-MPE on Batch Download</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you check this, then if you start a batch download, for each downloaded patch, Edisyn will automatically write a multimode patch which points to it, including the current name, bank, and (single patch) number.  The multimode patch number will be the same as the single number.  Thus if you download exactly one bank of single patches, you'll have multimode patches loaded for all of them.  

<p>Why is this connected to batch download?  Because in order to properly write multimode patches, Edisyn needs to know the <i>name</i> of the single-mode patch to which they refer (so it can call the multimode patch by the same name).  To do this it must load the single-mode patch.  The easiest way to load single-mode patches in bulk is by hijacking the bulk download facility.  So there you have it.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b> Only two at present:

<ul>
<li>
If you load the current patch, the Blofeld does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.

<p><li>
If you send a patch, or modify its parameters, the Blofeld's patch screen does not indicate that it's been edited (as it usually does with a little inverted "E"), even though it has in fact been edited.
</ul>
