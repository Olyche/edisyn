<h1>Waldorf Microwave II / XT / XTk</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Microwave II,</b> the <b>Waldorf Microwave XT,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Microwave XTk</b> in 10 voice or in 30 voice.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Microwave to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex.</b>  Also set <b>Receive</b> to on.

<p><b>XT/XTk Options</b> Some options are only available for the Microwave XT and Microwave XTk:

<ul>
<li><b>External Option</b> (In the Mixer) lets you specify how much the external audio input is mixed into the device.
<p><li><b>Additional Effects</b> The <b>Delay,</b> <b>Pan Delay,</b> and <b>Mod Delay</b> effects are only available on the XT and XTk.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b> The Microwave series has a few sysex bugs.

<ul>
<li>If you load the current patch, the Microwave does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.  Thus Edisyn resets the Bank to <b>A</b> and the Number to <b>1</b>.   Beware of this, as you may more than once accidentally write the patch to A1.

<p><li>The Microwave does not respond to nor does it send parameter changes for effect type.  So changing it on the machine will not update Edisyn, and changing it in Edisyn will not update the machine (until you send or receive a patch).

<p><li> Changing the arpeggiation triggers in Edisyn doesn't update then on the Microwave's scren, though they're updated in memory internally.  Similarly, changing the name in Edisyn doesn't update the name in the
name edit screen, though it's changed internally.

4. The Overdrive Effect's Amp Drive parameter is weirdly biased towards "Stack" due to how it's encoded in Waldorf's sysex. 
</ul>
