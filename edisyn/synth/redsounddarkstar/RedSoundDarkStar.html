<h1>Red Sound DarkStar and DarkStar XP2</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This patch editor works fine on the DarkStar XP2; it likely will not work properly on the DarkStar but will soon once we get a bit more sysex data from DarkStar users.  It is not meant to work with the Vocoda.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set Protect to OFF (Utility 3).  Set the Master MIDI Channel (Utility 8) to the same channel as Edisyn is using. 

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<p>The DarkStar's sysex is extremely limited.  
<ul>
<li> There is no way for Edisyn to request a patch.  You will need to send a patch manually from the DarkStar via Save Program (Utility 5).  Edisyn also responds to Save Part Voice (Utility 4) and Save All Programs (Utility 6 or 7).

<p><li> Similarly there is no way to request a merge.

<p><li>The DarkStar also has no way to send to a specific patch: you can only send to the current patch memory, or write to a patch.

<p><li>The DarkStar cannot respond to individual patch parameter changes.
</ul>
