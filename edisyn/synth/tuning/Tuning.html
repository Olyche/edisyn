        <h1>Midi Tuning Standard</h1>
        <h2>IMPORTANT NOTE</h2>
        <b>MAKE SURE YOU SET THE DEVICE NUMBER APPROPRIATELY IN THE MIDI MENU!</b> It will
        not work otherwise.
        <h2>Knob View</h2>
        Midi Tuning Standard works by assigning a pitch to every midi value from
        0-127. Each of these knob pairs represents the frequency to assign to that midi
        value.
        <br/><br/>
        You compute the pitch by choosing an original note from the
        12-tone-equal-temperment, A4-440hz, standard modern western tuning as well as
        an offset in cents from 0-100 above that note. Your resolution in cents is
        100/2<sup style="font-size:small">16</sup>. The
        knob panel as it stands is a direct representation of the midi tuning standard
        sysex and allows you to manually input your desired values. <b>However</b>,
        this is not the recommended way to set these values. The <b>Tuning</b> menu
        option has utilities for calculating these knobs in bulk.
        <br/>
        <h2>Tuning Utilities</h2>
        <b>EDO</b><br/>
        EDO stands for Equal number of Divisions per Octave and is also commonly known
        as Equal Temperament. Standard western tuning would be 12 EDO with A4 (midi
        note 69) set to 440hz. Other tunings have their advantages and disadvantages
        and a decent summary of the topic can be found
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">here</a>.  The
        calculate button gives the frequency of the selected midi number in standard
        western tuning, but feel free to use any positive number for frequncy for any
        midi note number as your root, all it is saying is "I want midi number x from
        my controller to equate to frequency y and to tune the rest of the notes using
        equal temperment with z divisons per octave."

        <b>Named Scales</b><br/>
        These are scales that are either popular enough or notable enough to be named. You
        can find out more about them on wikipedia.
