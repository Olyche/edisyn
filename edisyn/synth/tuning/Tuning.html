        <h1>Midi Tuning Standard</h1> 
        <h2>Knob View</h2>
        Midi Tuning Standard works by assigning a pitch to every midi value from
        0-127. Each of these knob pairs represents the frequency to assign to that midi
        value.
        <p>
            You compute the pitch by choosing an original note from the
            12-tone-equal-temperment, A4-440hz, standard modern western tuning as well as
            an offset in cents from 0-100 above that note. Your resolution in cents is 100/2<sup style="font-size:small">16</sup>. The
            knob panel as it stands is a direct representation of the midi tuning standard
            sysex and allows you to manually input your desired values. <b>However</b>,
            this is not the recommended way to set these values. The <b>Tuning</b> menu
            option has utilities for calculating these knobs in bulk.
        </p>
        <h2>Tuning Utilities</h2>
        <h3>EDO</h3>
        EDO stands for Equal number of Divisions per Octave and is also commonly known
        as Equal Temperament. Standard western tuning would be 12 EDO with A4 (midi
        note 69) set to 440hz. Other tunings have their advantages and disadvantages
        and a decent summary of the topic can be found
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">here</a>.  The
        calculate button gives the frequency of the selected midi number in standard
        western tuning, but feel free to use any positive number for frequncy for any
        midi note number as your root, all it is saying is "I want midi number x from
        my controller to equate to frequency y and to tune the rest of the notes using
        equal temperment with z divisons per octave."
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        Currently the only tool available is EDO, but more should be available soon.
