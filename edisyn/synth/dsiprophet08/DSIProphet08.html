<h1>Dave Smith Instruments Prophet '08</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Prophet '08</b> and <b>Prophet '08 Desktop</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set the MIDI channel to the same as being used in Edisyn.  Set MParamSend to NRPN.  Set M Param Rec to All or NRPN.  Set MIDI Program to ON.  Set MIDI Sysex to ON.  And set MIDIParamLCD to ON.

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>When you set the destination for a sequencer track to "Osc 1 Freq", "Osc 2 Freq", or "Osc 1&2 Freq", the track dials will change from number values to notes.  The lowest note, <b>C0</b>, corresponds to the note being played by the user -- that is, all sequenced notes are equal to or higher than the played note.  If you need notes lower than the played note, pitch the oscillator frequencies down.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Even if MIDIParamLCD is set to ON, any real-time changes you make won't be reflected on the Prophet '08 LCD unless you first twiddle a knob so the Prophet '08 is in its edit mode.  I suggest twiddling the Misc Parameters Select knob.

<p><li>Additionally, even if MIDIParamLCD is on, and the Prophet '08 is displaying parameter edits, you won't see parameter changes from Layer B unless you press "Edit Layer B".

<P><li>If you change Key Sync for some LFO other than #1, the Key Sync light won't change properly, even if that LFO is currently selected on the Prophet '08 front panel.  You have to press some other LFO button, then go back to the LFO in question to see the Key Sync button light properly.
</ul>
