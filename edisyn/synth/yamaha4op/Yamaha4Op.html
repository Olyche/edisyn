<h1>Yamaha 4-Operator FM Synthesizer Family</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This patch editor is meant to work with a variety of Yamaha 4-Op FM synthesizers, including the DX21, DX27, DX100, TX81Z, DX11, TQ5, YS100, YS200, and B200.  It will not work with the DX9 nor the FB01.  Its compatibility with later 4-Op synths, such as the WT11, V50, and DS55, is unknown.  The patch editor was originally designed for, and primarily tested on, the TX81Z.  It has also been tested on the TQ5.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your synthesizer's receive and transmit channel to the same thing (perhaps Channel 1).  Set the program change to be <b>Com</b> (Common).  Make sure that Sysex reception and transmission are turned <b>on</b> and that memory protect is <b>off</b>.

<p><b>Setting the Synthesizer Type</b>.  The 4-Op synthesizers differ from one another in how their memory is organized (banks, patches, etc.), and how they respond to change-patch requests.  You have to let Edisyn know what kind of synthesizer you're using or else it'll make the wrong kind of requests.

<p><b>Per-Synthesizer Parameters</b>.  Some 4-Op synthesizers have parameters and options that others do not.  Various parameters in this patch editor are labeled to indicate this.  You may see: <b>21</b> for the DX21, <b>27</b> for the DX27, <b>100</b> for the DX100, <b>11</b> for the DX11, <b>TX</b> for the TX81Z, and the special symbol <b>&gt;</b> which indicates later synthesizers, notably the TQ5, YS100, YS200, and B200.

<p><b>Bank Sysex</b> This patch editor knows about bank sysex messages (which group together multiple patches) as well as single-patch sysex messages.  If Edisyn loads or receives a bank sysex message, you will be given the option to edit a patch from it, to save the whole bank sysex, or to upload the whole bank sysex.

<p><b>About the Menu</b> If you mutate or recombine patches (using randomize, merge, hill-climb, or nudge) it may result in unfortunate operator frequency results. The Restrict Mutated Frequency Ratios... menu lets you restrict mutation or recombination of operator frequecies so that they only result in integer values or only to coarse-tune settings (either way, no fine tune).  I suggest integers.  I strongly suggest you also edit the mutation parameters to remove Fixed Frequency, Detune, and Frequency Ratio Fine from every operator, and also Transpose from the global settings.


<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>
4-op synthesizers like the TX81Z have no way to write patches from sysex: you will have to send the current patch from Edisyn, then manually save it to your desired patch location on the synthesizer itself.

<p><li>The 4-op family is very unusual in that patches aren't single sysex commands, but a sequence of them (so-called VCED, ACED, ACED2, and EFEDS sysex commands).  Thus when you save a patch to a file in Edisyn, you'll actually be saving <b>multiple</b> sysex commands concatenated together.  You should be aware of this in case you try sending this patch later from some librarian software or editor (it shouldn't be a problem).  Similarly, if another editor has saved multiple single patches (rather than a bank (or VMEM) patch) to a single file, because they come in pairs, Edisyn at present cannot read any more than the first one.

<p><li>On the TX81Z and DX11 (but not other 4-op synths) changing patches is weird.  I think I have a method which should work for all of them, but if it strange things happen, let me know.

</ul>
