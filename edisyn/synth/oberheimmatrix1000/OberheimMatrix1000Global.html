<h1>Oberheim Matrix 1000</h1> 
<h2>Global Parameters Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Oberheim Matrix 1000</b>.  It will not work with the 6 or 6R.

<p><b>Why a Global Parameter Editor?</b><br> As a rule, Edisyn does not have editors for global or master parameters for synthesizers, because they're usually set-and-forget affairs with a small number of parameters which can be controlled from the machine's front panel.  However the Matrix 1000 is different: it has some very important global parameters -- notably vibrato LFO settings -- which cannot be set in any other way other than via an editor.  So Edisyn's rule is broken in this case.

<p>The Matrix 6/6R has a similar set of globals, though it's different enough that we can't easily make an editor which covers both.  The 6/6R also has a few parameters which can't be edited except from an editor, but they're minor and not very important.  So for now the rule holds for the 6/6R. 

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br> Make sure that Memory Protect is off (see page 36 of the manual). 

<p><b>About the Group Patch Tabs</b><br>
Multiple Matrix 1000 machines can be chained together to effectively form a single larger machine.  This is done via the <b>Group Mode</b> options.  See page 29 of the manual.  

<p>Additionally each patch (0-999) can be independently set up to use group mode or to ignore it and treat the machine as an independent synthesizer. Why I have absolutely no idea.  See page 31.  Thus there are 1000 checkboxes, one for each patch.
