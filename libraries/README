INSTALLATION

Edisyn requires coremidi4j installed.  This is easy on the Mac: just copy the file

	coremidi4j-1.0.jar

... to the directory /Library/Java/Extensions/

and you're done!



DISTRIBUTION

The Jar File coremidi4j-1.0.jar is distributed under the Eclipse Common License.
Edisyn does not modify or extend it, but just links against it.  If you would like
the source code to this jar file, you're in luck!  It's embedded within the jar
file itself, in a subdirectory called "source".

The CoreMidi4J distribution is maintained here:
	https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J

I'd go there for the most recent copies.
